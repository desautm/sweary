Sweary is an R package that contains a database of swear words from different languages, cherry picked by native speakers.

## Installation

The development version of this package can be installed using [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools):

```
devtools::install_github("pdrhlik/sweary")
```

## Current swear word lists

| Language      | Language code | Number of swear words |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
`r glue_collapse(lang_counts$label_row, sep = "\n")`
| **Total**     | **`r nrow(lang_counts)` langs**   | **`r sum(lang_counts$n)`**               |

## Examples

All languages are stored in a `swear_words` data frame.

```{r ex_all_langs}
library(sweary)
head(swear_words)
```

You can only extract one language that you are interested in.

```{r ex_one_lang}
en_swear_words <- get_swearwords("en")
head(en_swear_words)
```

## Add (modify) a language

If you are not comfortable with `git` and pull requests, you can just follow steps **1-3**. After you create the file, send it to me via [email](mailto:patrik.drhlik@gmail.com) with a subject **New sweary language: {LANG_CODE}**. We will acknowledge you in the README after we approve of the changes.

1. **Choose a new language.**\
    Find its two letter [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).\
    If the language you are creating is a certain dialect (e.g. Canadian French), find its [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) in this [language code table](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).
2. **Create a language file.**\
    Place the file in `data-raw/swear-word-lists/{LANG_CODE}`.\
    Examples:\
    + English: `data-raw/swear-word-lists/en`
    + Canadian French: `data-raw/swear-word-lists/fr-CA`
3. **Fill in the file with swear words.** Following rules must apply:
    + **One** swear word per line with no trailing whitespace.
    + All words must be **lowercase**.
    + The list must only contain **unique** words.
    + The list must be **sorted** alphabetically.
4. **Make sure all the tests pass.**\
    You can do that using a development function called `build_sweary()`. It becomes available when you `git clone` the repository and call `devtools::load_all()`. Or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+L` in RStudio. Learn more about calling this function using `?build_sweary`.
5. **Update README.Rmd**.\
    Update the `langs` data frame in README.Rmd by adding a new row to it. More precise instructions are in the raw file itself.
6. **Create a pull request.**

## Origin

The idea first appeared after the [South Park text analysis lightning talk](https://github.com/pdrhlik/southparktalk-whyr2018) at the [Why R? 2018 conference](http://whyr2018.pl/) in Wrocław. All the contributors will be acknowledged as the work progresses.
